cadaver
=======

Cadaver unofficial repo - based on cadaver-0.23.3

Original can be found here: http://www.webdav.org/cadaver/

#### Changes

* make it compile with openssl v3 - Ubuntu does not support the openssl v2 calls.
* Add an option to always trust untrusted certificates (so you can use it in scripts easier)
